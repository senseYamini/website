                <h3>Practical Defense Against Adversarial WiFi Sensing(IEEE ANTS 2024)</h3>
                <p>Non-intrusive approach of WiFi-based sensing has expanded its 
                    market presence. It leverages existing communication infrastructure, 
                    extracting Channel State Information (CSI) for area assessment. 
                    However, the method’s susceptibility to misuse, termed the 
                    Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) problem, 
                    necessitates robust defenses. Our study introduces a 
                    black-box defense against adversarial attacks on CSI, 
                    reducing classification model accuracy from 98% to 17% 
                    while maintain ing strong communication throughput. 
                    Additionally, our method preserves a median Signal-to-Noise 
                    Ratio (SNR) difference of 1dB for perturbed samples, 
                    enhancing overall system reliability.</p>

                <h3>Improving Network Resource Utilization for Distributed 
                    Wireless Sensing Applications(AIoT@MobiHoc2024)</h3>
                <p>Edge-assisted wireless sensing is increasingly popular, 
                    where complex neural network models perform inference tasks 
                    on wireless channel state information (CSI) data streamed 
                    from IoT devices. However large volumes of CSI data sent 
                    across the network for inference can significantly impact
                     network bandwidth and reduce the Quality of Experience. 
                     This work tackles the challenge of optimizing network 
                     resource utilization in wireless sensing systems by compressing 
                     and subsampling CSI streams. We evaluate methods that quantize and 
                     selectively subsample CSI data before transmission to the edge server, 
                     which is then fed to the inference models. Such approach reduces 
                     bandwidth and computational load, improving data transmission 
                     and processing efficiency. Experiments conducted in two real 
                     testbeds (indoors as well as outdoors) show how CSI compression 
                     preserves sensing information integrity while enhancing system 
                     performance in terms of latency, energy efficiency, and throughput. 
                     By integrating quantization and subsampling with edge computing, 
                     this work enhances wireless sensing systems, making them more scalable 
                     and efficient in utilizing network resources.</p>
