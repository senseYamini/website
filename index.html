                I am a PhD scholar in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at
                IIT Madras. My research interests span Wi-Fi sensing, indoor localization,
                resource-efficient wireless systems, and the broader implications of sensing on
                network performance, energy consumption, and privacy.

                <h3>Less is More: Improving WiFi Localization Accuracy with Fewer Scans</h3>
                <p><strong>COMSNETS 2026</strong> (Accepted for presentation)</p>
                <p class="pub-text">
                    Traditional WiFi-based indoor localization pipelines rely on dense and frequent scanning to
                    achieve good accuracy. However, aggressive scanning drains device battery, increases channel 
                    contention, and scales poorly as the number of users grows. In this work, we show that more 
                    scans do not necessarily mean better localization. Through extensive experiments across 
                    diverse indoor environments, we uncover a surprising insight: only a small subset of carefully 
                    selected scans captures most of the localization signal strength. We systematically analyze the 
                    relationship between scan count, spatial diversity, and localization error.
                    We propose a lightweight scan-scheduling strategy that adapts scan frequency to environmental 
                    dynamics and user motion, achieving high accuracy with minimal overhead.

                <p><strong>IEEE ANTS 2025</strong> (Accepted for presentation)</p>
                <p class="pub-text">
                    Work carried out during internship at SRIB (Samsung R&amp;D Institute India – Bangalore).
                    LiteTrack investigates how to make on-device, Wi-Fi-based indoor localization more power-efficient
                    on smartphones. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark the minimum number of Wi-Fi scans
                    required to achieve reliable localization while reducing battery consumption. We quantify the
                    accuracy–energy trade-off across scan rates and propose a practical scanning policy that retains
                    robust localization performance with significantly fewer scans—extending battery life without
                    sacrificing user experience.

                <p><strong>IEEE ANTS 2024</strong></p>
                <p class="pub-text">
                    We present a black-box perturbation defense for CSI-based sensing that significantly reduces
                    adversarial classifier accuracy while maintaining communication quality (≈1&nbsp;dB median SNR
                    delta). The approach targets realistic ISAC threats with minimal overhead and strong practicality.
